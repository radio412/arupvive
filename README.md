HTML based on typical Bootstrap using the following template:

# [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/) - [Landing Page](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/landing-page/)

This project deviates from the template folder structure to allow for NPM updates to dependencies. The template uses a straightforward bootstrap layout with no specific bootstrap add-ons, plugins or modules. However since this was a free template, errors may occur on dependency updates without support. It's just HTML and Bootstrap though for a static webpage. This project may never change ever again. 

Yay.
